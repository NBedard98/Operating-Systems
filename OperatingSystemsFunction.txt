One operating system function is providing interface. You simply cannot have a working or functioning computer like we do today without this, this helps input all information and communications between different devices to the computer or humans to the computer and finds a way to express the information in a way we can understand. In other words, it allows the user to interact with the software or hardware. 
Another fundamental for operating systems is security. Security is the manager for everything you use on your system and controls everything; this will help keep all your information confidential and tell you about system integrity or availability. The job of security is not only to keep your information confidential, but everything in the system safe from threats of viruses, hackers, or malware as well. Security is one of the biggest functions of an OS system, especially in businesses, as it holds so much valueable information of the employees and the workplac  itself. Any of it being taken or stolen can create a lot of tension and issues, and a threat to public safety.
The third important function for an OS system is file management. This helps to organize important information and make for easy use and navigation of the computer system; such as a searchable database for quick findings. It's great for an increase of business flow and eliminates misfiling/loss of files, even when deleted, you are able to retreive them or copy files even.
